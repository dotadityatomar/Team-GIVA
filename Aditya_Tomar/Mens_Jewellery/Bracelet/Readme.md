## How the Code Works

### HTML Structure

The page is structured into several sections:

- **Header**: Contains the navigation links, logo, and search bar.
- **Hero Section**: Features a promotional banner with an image and centered text.
- **Product Section**: Displays jewelry items in a grid layout, each product card containing an image, description, price, and button.
- **Footer**: Contains three main areas: quick links, information, and contact details.

Here's a sample of the HTML structure:

```html
<section class="products">
    <div class="product-card">
        <img src="assets/product1.png" alt="Oxidised Silver Zodiac Spin Pendant">
        <h2>Oxidised Silver Zodiac Spin Pendant</h2>
        <p class="rating">4.9 ★ (13)</p>
        <p class="price">₹2,799</p>
        <button>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
</section>
```

### CSS Styling

The styles are handled by `styles.css`, where Flexbox and Grid layouts are used to make the design responsive. Media queries are used to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.

#### Example CSS for the Product Grid:

```css
.products {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    gap: 20px;
    padding: 50px;
}

.product-card {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

.product-card img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}

.price {
    color: green;
    font-size: 18px;
}
```

---

## Responsive Design

The page is designed to be responsive across various devices, from small smartphones to large desktop screens. Media queries ensure that the product grid and text elements adjust their layout according to the screen size.

### Mobile View

On mobile devices, the product grid changes to a single-column layout, ensuring that the content remains easy to navigate and view.

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .products {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    }

    .hero {
        padding: 50px 10px;
    }
}
```

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page, including layout design, font styles, and media queries for responsiveness.
- **Flexbox & CSS Grid**: Used to create flexible and responsive layouts.
- **Google Fonts**: Fonts were imported to style the text.
- **FontAwesome**: Used for icons like star ratings.

---

## Future Improvements

There are several potential improvements to this project:

1. **JavaScript Interactivity**: Add JavaScript functionality to enable dynamic behaviors like filtering products, adding items to a shopping cart, or implementing search functionality.
2. **Animations**: Adding CSS animations for hover effects on buttons and product cards.
3. **Backend Integration**: Connect the page to a backend to fetch products dynamically from a database, allowing users to add items to a cart and complete purchases.
